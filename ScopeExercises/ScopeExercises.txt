Javascript Scope Exercises

1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
x = 1;
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = function(a, b, c) {
        var x = 10;        
        document.write(x); // Output: 10
        document.write(a); // Output: 8
        var f = function(a, b, c) {
                b = a;              
                document.write(b);  // Output: 8
                b = c;
                var x = 5;
            }
        f(a,b,c);
        document.write(b);  // Output: 9
 }
c(8,9,10);
document.write(b);  // Output: 10
document.write(x);  // Output: 1

    The code will print out: 10 8 8 9 10 1

2. What is the difference between a method and function?
    Function: perform some specific set of task. It needs keyword function
    Method: property of an object containing a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.

3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?
    'this' refers to the current object in a Java method


4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?
    Inside an objects method, this is used to refer to object itself.
    The keyword 'this' is mandatory in Javascript

5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?
    The keyword this inside the constructor function points to the newly created object


6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?
    'this' refers to object x;

7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?
    Free variable: A variable referred to by a function that is not one of its parameters or local variables


8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.

    var o = {
        name:"fred:,
        major:"music",
        number: function(a,b){
            if (a < b)
                return a;
            else if (a > b)
                return b;
            else 
                return a*b;
        },

    }

9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.

    function Employee(name, salary, position){
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
        this.position = position;
    }
    var employee1 = new Employee("Tabitha", "100000.00", "Project Manager");
    var employee2 = new Employee("William", "200000.00", "Software Developer");
    var employee3 = new Employee("Alex","89000.00","HR");


10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
arguments.

    function product(){
        var product = 0;
        var i;
        for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++){
            product = product * arguments[i];
        }
        return product;
    }

    // Example for input:  var x = product(1,2,3,5,6);


11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.

    maximum = (a,b,c) => {
        var temp = a<=b? b : a;
        return temp<=c? c : temp;
    }
